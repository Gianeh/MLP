# Neural Network Project

This project involves training a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network on a dataset and visualizing the results.

## Files

- `main.py`: This is the main script where the neural network is created, trained, and tested. It also includes code for generating a plot of the network's predictions over a range of input values.

## Process

1. The script starts by printing the training data for reference.
2. A MLP neural network is created with 2 input nodes, 1 output node, and a hidden layer with 5 nodes. The activation function is set to "sigmoid" and the loss function is set to "mean squared error".
3. The network is then printed for reference.
4. The network is trained on the training data for 2000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1 and a batch size of 100.
5. The network is tested by predicting the output for the input `[1,1]`. The output is printed.
6. The script then generates a uniform distribution of points in the range `[-0.5,1.5] x [-0.5,1.5]` and predicts the output for each point. These predictions are added to a plot.
7. The plot is saved as `plot.png`.

## Example Plots

Here are the example plots generated by the script:
